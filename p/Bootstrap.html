                JavaScript was initially created to “make web pages alive”. The programs in this language are called scripts. ... When JavaScript was created, it initially had another name: “LiveScript”. 
                But Java was very popular at that time, so it was decided that positioning a new language as a “younger brother” of Java would help.
                It was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was an engineer at Netscape. 
                It was originally going to be named LiveScript but was renamed. Unlike most programming languages, the JavaScript language has no concept of input or output. 
                It is designed to run as a scripting language in a host environment, and it is up to the host environment to provide mechanisms for communicating with the outside world. 
                The most common host environment is the browser.
